# ShopEase 🛍️  
A Simple E-Commerce Web App

ShopEase is a lightweight e-commerce website built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to browse products, search by name, filter by category, and manage a shopping cart — all without any backend. Product data comes from a public API, and the cart is powered by `localStorage`, so everything runs smoothly right in the browser.
