ShopEase: A Simple E-Commerce Website
ShopEase is a basic e-commerce web app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It lets users browse a list of products, search by name, filter by category, and manage a shopping cart — all without needing a backend. Product data is pulled from a live API, and the cart is handled using localStorage, so everything runs entirely in the browser.

Why I Built This
This project was a way to strengthen my JavaScript skills by building something practical. The idea was to simulate a real e-commerce experience while covering essential concepts like DOM manipulation, form handling, API integration, and basic state management using the browser’s localStorage.

What It Can Do
Live Product Feed – Products are fetched in real-time from the FakeStore API.

Search – Easily find products by typing part of their name.

Category Filter – View only the items you’re interested in by selecting a category.

Add to Cart – Add products to your cart and track the quantity.

Cart Summary – See all the items in your cart, how many you’ve added, and the total price.

Remove Items – Delete any product from your cart with a single click.

Persistent Cart – Cart data is saved in localStorage, so it stays even if you refresh or close the browser.
