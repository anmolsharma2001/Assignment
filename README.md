# ShopEase 🛍️  
A Simple E-Commerce Web App

ShopEase is a lightweight e-commerce website built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to browse products, search by name, filter by category, and manage a shopping cart — all without any backend. Product data comes from a public API, and the cart is powered by `localStorage`, so everything runs smoothly right in the browser.

## 🚀 Why I Built This

I created ShopEase as a hands-on way to sharpen my JavaScript skills by building something real and interactive. The goal was to mimic the core features of an online store while practicing DOM manipulation, working with APIs, handling forms, and managing state using the browser's built-in storage.
